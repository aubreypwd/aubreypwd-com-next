								So today for #5ftf @WebDevStudios I thought I was going to work on fixing a few things on my fork of rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng and work some of them upstream, but I actually decided to use the panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend theme both of them are based on.
								So here it is! üôåüèª ‚Äî It‚Äôs basically the same thing but a little easier to configure and work on.
								Here‚Äôs how it looked before: Checkout the source ‚Üí

								So, the last few weeks I‚Äôve had a thing happen since switching to a MacBook Air recently. Since the CPU is not up to snuff as my old MacBook Pro (more to come on this switch later ‚å®Ô∏è), Sublime Text would hang for about a second on save of a file in a large project.
								This likely went un-notice on my 2.7Ghz MacBook Pro, but started to notice it on my Air.

								Morning Afternoon Evening   Morning  The works of the gods are full of providence, and the works of fortune are not separate from nature or the interweaving and intertwining of the things governed by providence. Everything flows from there. Further factors are necessity and the benefit of the whole universe, of which you are a part. What is brought by the nature of the whole and what maintains that nature is good for each part of nature.

								Morning Evening   Morning  Be like the headland, on which the waves break constantly, which still stands firm, while the foaming waters are put to rest around it. ‚ÄòIt is my bad luck that this has happened to me.‚Äô On the contrary, say, ‚ÄòIt is my good luck that, although this has happened to me, I can bear it without getting upset, neither crushed by the present nor afraid of the future.

								Morning Afternoon Evening   Morning  It isn‚Äôt the things themselves that disturb people, but the judgements that they form about them. Death, for instance, is nothing terrible, or else it would have seemed so to Socrates too; no, it is in the judgement that death is terrible that the terror lies. Accordingly, whenever we are impeded, disturbed or distressed, we should never blame anyone else but only ourselves, that is, our judgements.
